description: Research and analyze feature viability - GO/NO-GO decision gate
argument-hint: "<feature-slug>"
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** parse the user input to extract the feature slug (the folder name in `rpi/`).

**Expected Input Format**: `rpi/{feature-slug}/REQUEST.md`

## Purpose

This command performs comprehensive research and analysis of feature requests **before** the planning phase begins. It acts as a critical GO/NO-GO gate to determine whether a feature idea should proceed to detailed planning.

**Key Objectives**:
- Assess product-market fit and user value
- Evaluate technical feasibility and complexity
- Identify risks and potential blockers
- Determine the right approach (build, buy, partner, or decline)
- Make go/no-go recommendation with clear rationale

**Prerequisites**:
- Feature folder exists at `rpi/{feature-slug}/`
- Feature request file exists at `rpi/{feature-slug}/REQUEST.md`

**Output Location**: `rpi/{feature-slug}/research/RESEARCH.md`

**This is Step 2 (Research) of the RPI Workflow** (after Step 1: Describe).

## Outline

1. **Load Context**: Read feature description from `rpi/{feature-slug}/` and project constitution (if exists)
2. **Parse Feature Request**: Use requirement-parser agent to extract structured requirements
3. **Execute Multi-Phase Research**:
   - Phase 1: Parse Feature Request (requirement-parser agent)
   - Phase 2: Product Analysis with Constitution Alignment (product-manager agent)
   - Phase 2.5: Technical Discovery (Explore agent) - **CRITICAL: Deep code exploration**
   - Phase 3: Technical Feasibility (senior-software-engineer agent)
   - Phase 4: Strategic Assessment (technical-cto-advisor agent)
   - Phase 5: Generate Research Report (documentation-analyst-writer agent)
4. **Synthesize Recommendation**: Combine all analyses into clear go/no-go recommendation
5. **Validate Output**: Check against quality gates
6. **Report Completion**: Provide recommendation, next steps, and report location

## Phases

### Phase 0: Load Context

**Prerequisites**: Feature slug provided, `rpi/{feature-slug}/REQUEST.md` exists

**Process**:
1. **Read feature description**:
   - Read `rpi/{feature-slug}/REQUEST.md` (required)
   - Extract feature requirements and goals from REQUEST.md

2. **Check for project constitution** (optional):
   - Look for a constitution or principles document in the repository
   - Common locations: `constitution.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, `.project/constitution.md`
   - If found, extract core principles, constraints, and objectives

3. **Create research context**:
   - Synthesize into concise summary for agents
   - Identify key alignment criteria

**Outputs**:
- Feature description summary
- Constitutional principles (if found)
- Alignment criteria for evaluation

**Validation**:
- [ ] Feature folder exists in `rpi/{feature-slug}/`
- [ ] Feature description extracted
- [ ] Constitution checked and loaded (if exists)

**Purpose**: **CRITICAL PHASE** - Deeply analyze existing codebase BEFORE making technical feasibility assessment.

**Process**:
1. **Launch Explore agent** with target component(s)
2. **Agent investigates**:
   - **Existing Implementation**: What code already exists for similar functionality?

   - **Current Architecture**: How is the current system structured?
   - **Data Models**: What database schemas or data structures exist?
   - **Dependencies**: What libraries, services are already integrated?
   - **Existing Patterns**: What coding patterns and conventions are used?

3. **Agent provides**:
   - **Current State Summary**: What exists today
   - **Integration Analysis**: Where proposed feature would fit
   - **Code Conflicts**: What would break or conflict
   - **Leverage Opportunities**: What can be reused vs rebuilt
   - **Technical Constraints**: Real constraints from existing code

**Outputs**:
- Current implementation summary
- Integration points map
- Code conflicts identified
- Reusable components identified
- Technical constraints from code

**Critical**: This phase ensures Phase 3 is based on **actual code reality**, not assumptions.

## Error Handling

**If REQUEST.md doesn't exist**:
- Action: Stop and inform user
- Message: "Feature request file `rpi/{feature-slug}/REQUEST.md` not found. Create the feature folder and REQUEST.md first (Step 1: Describe in Plan Mode)."

**If feature description is too vague**:
- Action: requirement-parser will identify clarifying questions
- Message: "Need more information. Please answer:"
- Next: Wait for answers, then proceed

**If agents fail or timeout**:
- Action: Retry once
- Next: If retry fails, ask user whether to continue with incomplete research

---

## Notes

- **When to Use**: After Step 1 (Describe) creates the feature folder
- **Critical Gate**: This prevents wasted effort on non-viable features
- **Part of RPI Workflow**: Step 2 of 6 (Decompose → Describe → **Research** → Plan → Validate → Implement)

---

## Post-Completion Action

**IMPORTANT**: After completing the research workflow, ALWAYS prompt the user to compact the conversation:

> **Context Management**: This research workflow consumed significant context. To free up space for the next steps, please run:
>
> ```
> /compact
> ```
>
> This will summarize the conversation and preserve important findings while reducing token usage for subsequent commands.
